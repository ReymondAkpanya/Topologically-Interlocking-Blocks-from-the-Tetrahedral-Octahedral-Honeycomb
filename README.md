# Topologically Interlocking Blocks inside the
Tetroctahedrille

This repository contains additional data for the paper entitled "Topologically Interlocking Blocks inside the Tetroctahedrille" coauthored by Reymond Akpanya, Tom Goertzen and Alice C. Niemeyer (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01944v1 for a temporary version).

You can find code and files for constructing interlocking blocks and assemblies shown in the paper.

The code is written in GAP4 and you need to install the package SimplicialSurfaces. We also recommend installing the packages SelfIntersectionComplexes and GAPic (for creating STL-Files and visualisation purposes).

The folder STLFiles contains STL files for the blocks and assemblies depicted in the current version of the paper (soon available).

Do not hesitate to contact one of us in case you have any questions.
